# AIMeetingToJira
This project automates post-meeting follow-ups by turning raw meeting notes into structured action items and automatically creating Jira tickets. A serverless AWS backend uses an AI model to extract tasks with owners and due dates, reducing manual admin work and preventing missed follow-ups.
